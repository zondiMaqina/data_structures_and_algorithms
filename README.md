# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

This repository has some of the most common data structures used to handle data and the algorithms they also come with

## Solutions

[Peak Finding](./peak_finding)
  [linear implimentation](./peak_finding/linear_implimentation)
  [recursive implimenttation](./peak_finding/recursive_implimentation/peak_finding.rb)
[Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort/)
  [linear implimentation](./insertion_sort/linear_implimentation)
  [recursive implimenation](./insertion_sort/recursive_implimenation)

**For each algorithm used, there will be two types of approaches:**

- linear => using  linear time complexity in worst case scenario (O(n) time complexity)
- recursive => using Logarithmic time complexity given the same scenario (log(n) time complexity)

> [!NOTE]
> the recursive approaches will be using mostly the binary search algorithm which theoretically reduce the amount of work done for searching exponentially
