# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

Below are some common algorithms for searching or sorting data based on my implimentations with Ruby

## Solutions

- [Peak Finding](./peak_finding)
  - [linear implimentation](./peak_finding/linear_implimentation)
  - [Matrix peak finding](./peak_finding/linear_implimentation/2D_array_implimentation/peak_finding.rb)
  - [recursive implimenttation](./peak_finding/recursive_implimentation/peak_finding.rb)
- [Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort/)
  - [linear implimentation](./insertion_sort/linear_implimentation)
- [Bubble Sort](./bubble_sort/bubble_sort.rb)
- [Merge Sort](./merge_sort/merge_sort.rb)

**For each algorithm used, there will be two types of approaches:**

- Linearly
- Recursively

> [!NOTE]
> The algorithms above are are tested using the Ruby gem (framework) RSec (Ruby Specifications)
