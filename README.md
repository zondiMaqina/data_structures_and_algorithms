# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

Below are some common algorithms for searching or sorting data based ony my implimentations with Ruby

## Solutions

[Peak Finding](./peak_finding)
  [linear implimentation](./peak_finding/linear_implimentation)
  [Matrix peak finding](./peak_finding/linear_implimentation/2D_array_implimentation/peak_finding.rb)
  [recursive implimenttation](./peak_finding/recursive_implimentation/peak_finding.rb)
[Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort/)
  [linear implimentation](./insertion_sort/linear_implimentation)
  [recursive implimenation](./insertion_sort/recursive_implimenation)

**For each algorithm used, there will be two types of approaches:**

- Linearly
- Recursively

> [!NOTE]
> The algorithms in this repo are tested using the Ruby gem (framework) RSec (Ruby Specifications)
